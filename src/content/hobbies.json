I also enjoy spending time outdoors and am a travel photographer. Discovering new cultures, food and traditions is something I am deeply passionate about. When forced indoors, I resort to reading action thriller novels. A few of my favourites include Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' and Lee Child's 'Persuader'. I am a novice chef and find joy in cooking for family and friends. Being a tech and gadget fanatic, I try to keep myself constantly updated on the latest news and trends in the field."
